Dungeon Masters is a game where you and your teamates kill monsters, find
treasure chests, and get gold! 

## Objective

Get the most gold in your team. You can get gold by killing the most monsters,
finding secret treasure chests, and completing the loop of the circle.

## Turns

When you get your turn, you select a monster. Then you roll a 12 sided dice. If
the the number is higher or at the number you need to hit the target, then roll
again to see if it breaks the target's armor. If it does, then roll a 6 sided
dice to see how much damage it does. If any of the steps have a number lower
than the needed numbers, you don't attack.
