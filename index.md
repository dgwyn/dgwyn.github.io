Hi! My name is David, and I am going to tell you what I have learned from my dad every day.

Today when I was playing a game called 2 Touch, and was playing with the 1st
graders, I saw a boy named Ashley that was cheating. He relied on people to
kick the ball to help him. ususally, I would tell him to stop, but I didn't
because when my friends argue, they make trouble. Lots of trouble.

During the game a 5th grader joined. I was  a bit scared because 5th grader are
stronger and he was a soccer player. After a long time, I beat him, but when
beat him i was very sweaty. But I was very happy.

Today I was working on my science project. When I was typeing, I had trouble
because one of my paragraphs didn't really fit well with my main question. But
then my dad told me about impliclt and expliclt so I understanded.

### GitHub branches and PRs

I learned about branches. I was in a branch called master. Then me and my dad
made a branch called learning-pr.  A branch is used to make pull request which
are also called PRs. PRs are used so that someone else can review and approve.
