Hi! My name is David, and I am going to tell you what I have learned from my dad every day.

## Sunday, April 21

Today I was working on my science project. When I was typeing, I had trouble
because one of my paragraphs didn't really fit well with my main question. But
then my dad told me about impliclt and expliclt so I understanded.

### GitHub branches and PRs

I learned about branches. I was in a branch called master. Then me and my dad
made a branch called learning-pr.  A branch is used to make pull request which
are also called PRs. PRs are used so that someone else can review and approve.

Things I did and learned:

- got a github page
